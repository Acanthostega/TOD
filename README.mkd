Project:
--------

With this project, **TOD**, we want to propose a program which will dispatch a list of command on a list of machine.

First, the program will check if the machine is reachable.
Secondly, for each reachable machine, it will launch the associated command.
Thirsty, for each command it has not reach the associated machine, it will launch it on the first available machine.
